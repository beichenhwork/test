After each addition, vortex for 15 seconds and confirm that ahomogeneous solution has been obtained. If a clear solution is not obtainedat any point abort.</li>    <li>Leave tube at room temperature for 24 hours.</li>    <li>Note the presence of a precipitate then vortex for 15 seconds.</li>    <li>Centrifuge at x RPM for 60 seconds then discard supernatant.</li>    <li>Add 500 microliters of methanol, vortex for 15 seconds thencentrifuge at x RPM for 60 seconds.</li>    <li>Repeat the washing procedure for a total of 3 washes.</li>    <li>Put open tube under high vac for 15 minutes.</li>    <li>Record weight and obtain H and C NMR of entire sample inCDCl3.</li>    <li>Submit small sample for MS analysis.</li></ol><br><h1 id="toc2">Variations</h1> <ol>    <li>Amine and Aldehyde can be mixed and left for 3 hours beforeaddition of acid and isonitrile to see if it makes any difference.</li>    <li>One dram vials can be used instead of Eppendorf tubes.</li>    <li>Use vortexing or sonication to induce precipitation.</li></ol></body><address><p><hr>Mirrored from<a href="http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/EXPLAN001">http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/EXPLAN005</a>on Tuesday 21st October 2008.</address></html>
