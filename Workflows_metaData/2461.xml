The property name must be the same used in the HTML file returned by the HyperLEDA service. The workflow calls to HyperLEda service, using as input the names of the galaxies in order to get a HTML file with information about each galaxy. From each HTML file, it extracts the value of the property selected by the user.The workflow uses a python tool to parse the HTML file (one for each galaxy) and extracts the value of the property. In order to build a file, it has to merge the output of the python tool using thel local service "Merge_String_List_to_a_String"</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/19173" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=19173" id="19173">Susana</uploader>  <created-at>2011-10-05 09:21:39 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2461/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2461/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/8" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=8" id="8">BSD</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/2461/download/Extracting_Quantities_from_HyperLEDA-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
