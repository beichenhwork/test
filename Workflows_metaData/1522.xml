Titled "Who Wants to Be a Data Miner", three challenges were issued to the participants of the conference.  In all challenges, participants had to design RapidMiner processes as quickly as possible. This is the original solution I had in mind for Challenge 2: "Fibonacci Numbers". It defines a macro n, recurses by applying itself using an "Embed Process" operator on n-1 and n-2, appends the results (so the length is F(n-1)+F(n-2)) and uses a "Branch" operator to stop the recursion. The live solution from the challenge is in workflow "RCOMM Challenge 3: Fibonacci Numbers (Live solution)".</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/62" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=62" id="62">RapidMiner</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/4533" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=4533" id="4533">Simon Fischer</uploader>  <created-at>2010-09-17 08:57:42 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1522/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1522/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/1" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=1" id="1">by-nd</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/1522/download/RCOMM_Challenge_3__Fibonacci_Numbers__Intended_simple_solution_-v.txt</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.rapidminer.rmp+zip</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
