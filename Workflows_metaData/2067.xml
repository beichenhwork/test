A multiple sequence alignment and finally a phylogenetic analysis.&lt;hr/&gt;This workflow performs a generic protein sequence analysis. In order to do that a novel protein sequence enters into the software along with a list of known protein identifiers chosen by the biologist to perform a homology search, followed by a multiple sequence alignment and finally a phylogenetic analysis.&lt;hr/&gt;This workflow performs "parallel" generic protein sequence analysis. In order to do that a list of known protein identifiers chosen by the biologist enters into the software to perform different multiple sequence alignments and finally  phylogenetic analysis.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/1601" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=1601" id="1601">Achille Zappa</uploader>  <created-at>2011-04-18 10:54:06 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2067/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2067/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/2067/download/M_Super_aln_boot_phylo_New-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
