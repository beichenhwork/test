The user has the freedom to choose the flanking width around the gene for determining the SNPs. The input is in the form of entrez gene ids. Biomart services are used to determine the chromosome and position of the gene as well as determining Affy gene chip 6k ids. The final report is stored as a tab-delimited text file with Affy 6 gene chip ids for the SNP and Kegg info for the gene that it is associated with.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/17633" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=17633" id="17633">Harish Dharuri</uploader>  <created-at>2012-08-21 01:50:22 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/3108/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/3108/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/3108/download/Create_SNP_Set-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
