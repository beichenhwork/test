The latter permitted the scallops to bury&lt;br /&gt;themselves as in their natural habitat. Throughout the 7-month study, growth, as measured by shell&lt;br /&gt;length and muscle mass, was by far superior for scallops in the partly buried cages. Possible explanations&lt;br /&gt;for this are ( 1) that the scallops are stressed by enclosures which prevent them from burying&lt;br /&gt;themselves and (2) that organic material at the sediment/water interface is an important food resource&lt;br /&gt;and E. ziczac has better access to this when it buries itself flush with the bottom. The timing of gonadal&lt;br /&gt;growth and spawning varied markedly among treatments. Some spawnings coincided with temperature&lt;br /&gt;increases but others did not. Differences between scallops in suspension compared to those in bottom&lt;br /&gt;treatments suggested that reproduction is as much controlled by conditions in the immediate environment&lt;br /&gt;of the scallops as by large-scale environmental factors. Survival was highest for the scallops&lt;br /&gt;maintained in partly buried cages.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/80" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=80" id="80">PDF</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/65194" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=65194" id="65194">William Senior</uploader>  <created-at>2016-03-19 14:54:34 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4820/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4820/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/4820/download/Growth_of_the_tropical_scallop__Euvola__Pecten__ziczac__in_bottom_and_suspended_culture_in_the_Golfo_de_Cariaco__Venezuela-v.pdf</content-uri>  <content-type>application/pdf</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
