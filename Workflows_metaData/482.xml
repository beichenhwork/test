The content of that file is then saved to a temporary file by create_and_populate_xml_file.  The path to the temporary file is passed to the inFileURL port of Transform_XML.The get_xslt_file_from_web service downloads an example xslt file from myExperiment.  The content of that file is then saved to a temporary file by create_and_populate_xslt_file.  The path to the temporary file is passed to the xslFileURL port of Transform_XML.The Transform_XML service transforms the XML using the specified XSLT and sends the resultant XML document to its outputStr port and so to the workflow's out port.  The Transform_XML_service has the default for outputExt set to 'out' so the transformed XML document is also written to the file whose path is the same as that of the inFileURL but with '.out' as the extension.To check the content of the output file, its file path is calculated by calls of Filter_list_of_strings_extracting_match_to_a_regex and Concatenate_two_strings.  The file path is passed to the Read_Text_File service.  Once the Transform_XML service has finished, the Read_Text_File service reads the output file and echoes its content to the contents_of_output_file port of the workflow.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/1" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=1" id="1">Taverna 1</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/30" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=30" id="30">Alan Williams</uploader>  <created-at>2008-09-27 17:36:43 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/482/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/482/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/3" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=3" id="3">by</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/482/download/Transform_XML_-_output_file_by_extension-v.xml</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.scufl+xml</content-type>  <tags>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=555" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/555" id="555">example</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=935" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/935" id="935">localworker</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=662" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/662" id="662">mygrid</tag>  </tags></workflow>
