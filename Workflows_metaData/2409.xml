The property name must be the same used in the VOtable returned by the Vizier service. The workflow calls to sesame name resolver using as input the names of the galaxies and gets the coordinates. Then it calls to Vizier service and provides to it with the coordinates as input, in order to get a VOTable with information about each galaxy. From each VOTable, it extracts the value of the property selected by the user and then compares this values with the values provided by the file with the original values.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/19173" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=19173" id="19173">Susana</uploader>  <created-at>2011-09-23 13:32:16 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2409/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2409/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/8" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=8" id="8">BSD</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/2409/download/Comparing_Quantities-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
