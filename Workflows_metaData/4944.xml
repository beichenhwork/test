This allows that certain steps in workflow can be operated by human users rather than an end-to-end automatic process. This is helpful for activities in the workflow that currently cannot be executed by automatic process, and for the inspection activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workflow here utilized&amp;nbsp;a set of REST web services,&amp;nbsp;HTML pages, authentication services, client scripts(called by Tool service)&amp;nbsp;and SMTP service&amp;nbsp;deployed in a private server for internal demonstration purpose. Please contact&amp;nbsp;k.duan@sheffield.ac.uk&amp;nbsp;if you are interested in and have any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This service is a stand-alone generic service. It does not depend on any plug-in of Taverna. The interaction will be carried out through HTML pages sent to user&amp;#39;s Email&amp;nbsp;address. Thus, for example, all the interaction and inspection can be recorded, monitored and managed from server side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/63774" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=63774" id="63774">Kewei Duan</uploader>  <created-at>2016-10-26 14:20:16 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4944/versions/4/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4944/versions/4/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/4944/download/Interactive_Service-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
