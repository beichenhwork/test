Titled "Who Wants to Be a Data Miner", three challenges were issued to the participants of the conference.  In all challenges, participants had to design RapidMiner processes as quickly as possible. This is the winning process of Challenge 2: "Fibonacci Numbers" by Matko BoÅ¡njak. This was the task:The n-th Fibonacci number is F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2), and F(0)=0, F(1)=1. Create a process that creates an example set with F(n) rows where n can be defined as a macro of the process.This solution does even more than the intended result: It creates an example set where row i contains F(i).</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/62" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=62" id="62">RapidMiner</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/4533" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=4533" id="4533">Simon Fischer</uploader>  <created-at>2010-09-17 08:56:32 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1521/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1521/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/1" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=1" id="1">by-nd</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/1521/download/RCOMM_Challenge_3__Fibonacci_Numbers__Improved_live_solution_-v.txt</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.rapidminer.rmp+zip</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
