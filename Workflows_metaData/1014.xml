Other values may lead to errors,- when specifying more than one exon or effect, they must be in a unique input string but on distinct text lines</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/1" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=1" id="1">Taverna 1</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/1601" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=1601" id="1601">Achille Zappa</uploader>  <created-at>2010-01-15 16:22:15 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1014/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1014/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/1014/download/Search_TP53_Somatic_Mutation_catalogue_by_exon_and_by_effect_according_to_the_boolean_operators_____and________or____and____butnot_____and_retrieve_full_somatic_mutation_descriptions-v.xml</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.scufl+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
