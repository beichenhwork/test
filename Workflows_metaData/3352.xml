It provides a file with the SDSS identifiers of each target galaxy of the sample, environmental estimators and radius where the 10th companion has been found. The workflow looks for potential companions in radius ranging from 3Mpc to 11Mpc, with a step of 1Mpc. The user may modify these numbers at the input stage, as well as several limits and ranges needed in the filtering process. As in the previous workflow other provided input values are the Working Path of the digital experiment and the database connection settings: hostname, login and password.Execution environment The first requirement to run the workflows provided by both ROs is Taverna Workbench2 2.4 or higher. AstroTaverna (Taverna plugin) is also needed in order to get functionalities related with Virtual Observatory web services queries and management of standard VOTable data formats. In general, the execution environment is a Linux distribution including Python4 2.x and a bash shell, with psycopg and numpy Python packages. Access to a PostgreSQL database storing the physical parameters provided by SDSS is also needed; a dump file of database may be downloaded from the AMIGA web server and in order to be deployed and accessible from a local execution environment.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/14936" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=14936" id="14936">Jose Enrique Ruiz</uploader>  <created-at>2013-01-04 20:41:31 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/3352/versions/2/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/3352/versions/2/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/8" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=8" id="8">BSD</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/3352/download/Environment-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=681" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/681" id="681">astronomy</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=705" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/705" id="705">astrophysics</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=1293" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/1293" id="1293">data</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=688" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/688" id="688">database</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=3142" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/3142" id="3142">galaxies</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=2963" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/2963" id="2963">python</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=3706" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/3706" id="3706">sdss</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=2788" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/2788" id="2788">csv</tag>  </tags></workflow>
