The property name must be typed in the same way used in the HTML returned by HyperLEDAThe workflow calls to HyperLEDA using the names of the galaxies as input, and it returns a HTML file with information about the galaxy. This file is parsed by the python tool "ExtractPropertyValues", that extracts the value of the property introduced by the user. The results of this tool are written in a file, and with the file of the original values compose the input for the Make_comparing_file tool, that build a file with a comparision between the original values and the values got from LEDA.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/19173" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=19173" id="19173">Susana</uploader>  <created-at>2011-10-03 16:58:09 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2455/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2455/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/8" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=8" id="8">BSD</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/2455/download/Comparing_Quantities_using_HyperLEDA-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
