Permutation tests are computationally intensive, needing at least 1000 permutations per gene to obtain acceptable results. For large experiments, the in-built feature of running R/MAANOVA in a single cluster may not be enough. We are using WS- VLAM workflow management system [2] to create a Grid-enabled R/MAANOVA workflow (Grid-MAANOVA) that will simultaneously run in multiple clusters. This Grid implementation will have two levels of parallelization.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&lt;p&gt;Level 1:&amp;nbsp; Job-farming the genes The probe level R/MAANOVA scheme is intrinsically parallel: the F statistics where for each group of probe-sets can be computed independently. However, variations on group size and prob-set sizes may lead to unbalanced&amp;nbsp; computation time. This problem can be solved by splitting the groups with larger computation time into smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&lt;p&gt;Level 2: Job-farming the permutations If the computation time of a subset of genes is still too long, the permutation F test will be parallelized by submitting jobs containing an appropriate number of permutations. This will be done in three steps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/9" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=9" id="9">WSVLAM</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/1067" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=1067" id="1067">Zhiming Zhao</uploader>  <created-at>2008-12-05 14:06:06 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/595/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/595/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/595/download/Affimetrix_microarray__part_two__perm_-v.xml</content-uri>  <content-type>application/octet-stream</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
