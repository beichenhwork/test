The first thing you can expect to see is a pop up dialog asking if you trust the Web service to be invoked over HTTPS. You can use testuser/testpasswd as username and password for authentication when running the workflow. To see where the security is being configured, right-click the service in the diagram and select "Configure security" from the menu.You may experience problems running this workflow under versions of Java greater than 1.6. This is due to a change in security handling.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/30" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=30" id="30">Alan Williams</uploader>  <created-at>2012-04-05 16:55:34 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2867/versions/2/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2867/versions/2/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/2867/download/Secure_Web_service_call_example-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
