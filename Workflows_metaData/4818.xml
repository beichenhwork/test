The following results are found. 1) Contrary to the longstanding&lt;br /&gt;belief that Bergant&amp;iacute;n Bay is the main source of pollution of Pozuelos Bay (owing to the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oil related activities that take place there), it is shown that the opposite effect may occur under&lt;br /&gt;conditions of weak winds and flood tides; i.e., surface water in Pozuelos Bay within a range of&lt;br /&gt;about 3 kmhas the potential to enter into Bergant&amp;iacute;n Bay. 2) Spectral analysis of the wind signal&lt;br /&gt;showed that winds from the NE with periods of 6, 12 and 24 hours are the most energetic. The&lt;br /&gt;occurrence of these events in coincidence with tidal quarter-, semi- and diurnal components&lt;br /&gt;represents a high risk factor for oil tanker operations in both Bergant&amp;iacute;n Bay and Pozuelos Bay.&lt;br /&gt;Of particular interest was the description of the dynamic, both of the sea surface current and&lt;br /&gt;the wind during September, at which time the wind field showed a reversal of direction, blowing&lt;br /&gt;mainly from the south. This reversal creates a dramatic change in the local surface circulation,&lt;br /&gt;allowing sea surface waters from Pozuelos Bay to penetrate into Bergant&amp;iacute;n Bay for periods&lt;br /&gt;longer that 46 hours. It is concluded that it is of primary importance to establish as a primary&lt;br /&gt;goal the observation of the variable water exchange between Bergant&amp;iacute;n Bay and its neighbouring&lt;br /&gt;waters (by mean of the sampling of synoptic records of wind, sea surface levels and currents).&lt;br /&gt;Such measurements will help our national oil industry to improve the quality of the existent&lt;br /&gt;plans to control oils spills in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/80" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=80" id="80">PDF</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/65194" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=65194" id="65194">William Senior</uploader>  <created-at>2016-03-19 00:20:30 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4818/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4818/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/4818/download/Corrientes_superficiales_en_la_Bah_a_de_Bergant_n__Estado_Anzo_tegui__Venezuela_-v.pdf</content-uri>  <content-type>application/pdf</content-type>  <tags>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=4577" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/4577" id="4577">coastal pollution; currents; spectral analysis.</tag>  </tags></workflow>
