These sequences are retrieved and a blast database of them is created (by default, in the directory you ran taverna from). Warning: This workflow assumes that you have blastall and formatdb installed on the machine, and that by default, these are both found or linked in /usr/local/bin. It also assumes that you have write permission to the directory you have run taverna from. The beanshells "create_blastall_cmdArgs" and "create_formatdb_cmdArgs" are what you need to edit if the default locations are not appropriate for you.Shortcomings:The names of all the files created and used is hard coded in this workflow. This means that if you run this workflow more than once without editing anything, you will overwrite files you have previously created.The results are parsed using threshold values for percent identity similarity and e-value as input by the user and outputs those values above these thresholds.Credit: Bela</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/7581" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=7581" id="7581">Andrew David King</uploader>  <created-at>2010-03-19 12:09:15 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1169/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1169/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/1" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=1" id="1">by-nd</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/1169/download/BlastandParse1-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
