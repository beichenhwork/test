The RapidMiner process was allowed to download data from Wikipedia to make this decision.One input file contains a list of words for which two attributes "Vodka" or "Leader" with indicator variables are added when running the process. A second utility file contains links to Wikipedia pages on Vodka and leaders of the Soviet Union.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/62" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=62" id="62">RapidMiner</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/4533" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=4533" id="4533">Simon Fischer</uploader>  <created-at>2011-11-02 17:44:45 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2521/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2521/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/1" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=1" id="1">by-nd</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/2521/download/RCOMM_2011_Challenge_2__Vodka_or_President_-v.txt</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.rapidminer.rmp+zip</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
