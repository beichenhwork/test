It might also be the case that AC is already known. In that case AC does not represent a new discovery but will still be returned (see workflow example values). The B concepts are returned sorted on the percentage of the contributions of the individual concepts to the coherence score (the average of the inner product scores of all possible concept pairs within the group).The example values for this workflow are tailored to describe the relationship between two entrez gene ids. The user can change that by using other ids and a database identifier for the db (in our case is EG for entrez gene ids).</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/17730" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=17730" id="17730">Eleni</uploader>  <created-at>2015-04-03 20:49:37 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4630/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4630/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/4630/download/Explain_score_between_two_concepts_-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
