Users select the study region and the environmental variables considered to be the main drivers of a virtual species niche. The workflow is all based on the ENM components, which use the openModeller Web Service (OMWS). After getting initial parameters from the user, the workflow generates a random virtual niche. A random threshold within a given prevalence range is then used to separate suitable from unsuitable areas, from where random training and testing points are sampled. Training points are used to generate the models and independent testing points are used for external tests measuring the AUC. All steps (except mask and environmental layer selection) are repeated a given number of times to check if one of the the two kinds of models performs significantly better than the other. A single-run version of this workflow including model projections is available here: http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4536</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/20358" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=20358" id="20358">Renato De Giovanni</uploader>  <created-at>2014-11-13 15:20:51 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4535/versions/10/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4535/versions/10/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/4535/download/ENM_resolution_mix_-_multiple_runs_version-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
