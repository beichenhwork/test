The file paths to those files are then output by the create_and_populate_temporary_file beanshell.The create_temporary_file beanshell creates a file to which the concatentation can be written.The concatenate_files service concatenates the five files and writes the result to the temporary output file.  Because the displayresults port has been given a default value of 'true', the results are also copied to the results port of concatenate_files.The temporary file to which the results were written is read by the read_text_file service and its contents output.Both of the workflow outputs contain 'abcde' i.e. the contents of the concatenated files separated by a newline.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/30" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=30" id="30">Alan Williams</uploader>  <created-at>2010-10-28 14:39:23 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1584/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1584/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/3" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=3" id="3">by</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/1584/download/Concatenate_files_-_echo_results_and_multiple_files-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
