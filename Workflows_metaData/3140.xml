The task was to partially solve a Sudoku puzzle by solving three subtasks. Processes 1-3 in this pack are the actual solutions to the tasks, process 0 loads the required data into your repository and process 4 is the bonus that solves the entire puzzle.This process loads the numbers 1..9 and uses two Cartesian Product operators to compute the set of all combinations x, y, v. Finally we compute the index of the 3x3 sub-field as z=ceil(x/3) + ceil(y/3) * 3 - 3. We end up with a table representing all values we could possibly insert into a Sudoku puzzle, i.e. any combination of column x, row y, and value v. The sub-field index z is implicitly defined by x and y but will help us later.The result is saved in the table "All Possibilities" and will be used by process 2.Note that the data set "All Possibilities" has the same format as the input data set "Sudoku Predefined" which contains the numbers that are predefined in the Sudoku puzzle.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/62" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=62" id="62">RapidMiner</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/4533" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=4533" id="4533">Simon Fischer</uploader>  <created-at>2012-09-04 16:48:34 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/3140/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/3140/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/1" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=1" id="1">by-nd</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/3140/download/RCOMM_2012_Sudoku_Challenge__1_-_Generate_All_Possibilities-v.txt</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.rapidminer.rmp+zip</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
