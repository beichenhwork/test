The workflow proceeds as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&#13;First, it checks if there are proteins that are annotated both to the clinical event and to the drug (NESTED WORKFLOW ADR_substantiation_through_proteins).&lt;br /&gt;&#13;Second, it looks for connections between the drug and the clinical event through biological pathways. Information about tissue expression of the proteins is used to filter the results  Input of the workflow  The input of the workflow is a drug-event pair.   For the clinical events, the following types are allowed:  	1) UMLS CUI concept identifiers (single identifier or a list of identifiers 	2) clinical events observed as adverse drug reactions according to the EU-ADR project  For the drug, a ATC code (7 digit level) is required.  Output of the workflow  As result a list of connecting proteins as well as a list of pathways is provided.   The results can be visualized as a network using Cytoscape. The network is a multi-partite graph, in which the nodes are the event, the drug and the proteins, and the edges the associations between these nodes. In addition, all the evidences supporting the associations can be explored in the graph representation.  The results of the analyisis through biological pathways is summarized in an html file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/15418" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=15418" id="15418">Anna Bauer-Mehren</uploader>  <created-at>2011-08-07 09:07:21 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1988/versions/2/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/1988/versions/2/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/9" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=9" id="9">GPL</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/1988/download/ADR-S-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=2410" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/2410" id="2410">drug safety</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=2411" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/2411" id="2411">signal</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=2412" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/2412" id="2412">adverse drug reaction</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=2413" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/2413" id="2413">adr</tag>    <tag uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/tag.xml?id=39" resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/39" id="39">bioinformatics</tag>  </tags></workflow>
