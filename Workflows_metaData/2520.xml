The file opened by the operator &amp;quot;Open Ancestor&amp;quot; contains a table with details about parentship in the Baggins family (insert a breakpoint after read CSV). Each example contains a parent and a child. Of course, the same parent can be contained multiple times in the data set. The task of Challenge 1 was to find all descendants (and their their respective levels) from Balbo.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&lt;p&gt;This solution achieves this goal by starting with an example set with a single row (Balbo) and joining the parentship table. This yields all children of Balbo. Repeating this, all grandchildren are found. The process uses a loop to iterate down to level 6 (which is empty because no more information is provided for this level). Bilbo and Frodo are found on Levels 3 and 4, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/62" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=62" id="62">RapidMiner</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/4533" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=4533" id="4533">Simon Fischer</uploader>  <created-at>2011-11-02 17:43:08 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2520/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2520/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/1" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=1" id="1">by-nd</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/2520/download/RCOMM_2011_Challenge_1__Hobbit_Genealogy-v.txt</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.rapidminer.rmp+zip</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
