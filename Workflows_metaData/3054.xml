It receives two inputs:1) An ascii table with information about the image such as data of the field, name of the fits file or if it is barred or not.2) A configuration file with the paths where the files needed by the workflow can be found and other paths where to store the files generated by the workflowThis workflow extracts the band from the image header, and  the information about the field (kk, saturation, aa, airmass, gain) from the SDSS DR7 drfield VO service.Then it downloads the psfield file into the path provided by the configuration file, and it runs the program "read_psf" in order to build the psf file corresponding with the specific band of the image.The output of this workflow is made up of 13 lists:- Filenames: Paths where store files that are going to be generated (i.e. the output file of Sextractor)- psf: Paths where the psf files have been stored.- Band: List of bands correspondig to the image- nx and ny: NAXIS1 and NAXIS2- kk : List of  extinction coefficient values- saturation: List of saturation level values- aa: List of  zero-point values- airmass: List of airmass values- gain: List of Gain Averaged over Amplifiers values- ra,dec: List of coordinates- Bar: list of 1/0 indicating if the image of the corresponding row is barred or not</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/19173" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=19173" id="19173">Susana</uploader>  <created-at>2012-07-30 18:19:42 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/3054/versions/5/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/3054/versions/5/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/3054/download/Extract_SDSS_field_information_and_PSF-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
