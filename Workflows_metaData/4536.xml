Users select the study region and the environmental variables considered to be the main drivers of a virtual species niche. The workflow is all based on the ENM components, which use the openModeller Web Service (OMWS). After getting initial parameters from the user, the workflow generates a random virtual niche. A random threshold within a given prevalence range is then used to separate suitable from unsuitable areas, from where random training and testing points are sampled. Training points are used to generate the models and independent testing points are used for external tests measuring the AUC. This is a simplified version of the workflow http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4535 since it doesn't include experiment replication to check if one of the two types of model performs significantly better than the other. This workflow goes through all steps a single time, but it also includes model projection for illustration purposes.</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/20358" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=20358" id="20358">Renato De Giovanni</uploader>  <created-at>2014-11-18 17:11:02 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4536/versions/6/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4536/versions/6/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/4536/download/ENM_resolution_mix_-_single_run_version-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
