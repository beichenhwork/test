Results are exported in various formats, to facilitate the downstream evaluation in other programs and the sharing of data (EXCEL, csv, mzIdentML).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to a standard Trans-Proteomic-Pipeline (TPP) installation, the workflow can be to mass spectrometry data in whatever localization (i.e. the files do not have to be uploaded/ copied to a special directory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workflow was described in the article: Winkler R. An evolving computational platform for biological mass spectrometry: workflows, statistics and data mining with MASSyPup64. PeerJ. 2015 (https://peerj.com/articles/1401/).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since all dependencies (comet, TPP, ..) are installed on MASSyPup64, this m64 workflow should run without any further configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally to my previously uploaded protein identifcation workflow, the validated results are searched for a text pattern (e.g. protein name containing &amp;quot;xxx&amp;quot;) and matching results are written into a separate csv file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>  <type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/content_types/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/type.xml?id=2" id="2">Taverna 2</type>  <uploader resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/users/64710" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/user.xml?id=64710" id="64710">Robert Winkler</uploader>  <created-at>2015-12-10 00:20:46 UTC</created-at>  <preview>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4786/versions/1/previews/full</preview>  <svg>http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4786/versions/1/previews/svg</svg>  <license-type resource="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" uri="http://www.myexperiment.org/license.xml?id=2" id="2">by-sa</license-type>  <content-uri>https://myexperiment.org/workflows/4786/download/TTPish_workflow_for_MASSyPup64_with_text_search-v.t2flow</content-uri>  <content-type>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</content-type>  <tags/></workflow>
